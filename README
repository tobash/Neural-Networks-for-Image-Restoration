This project deals with neural networks and their application to image restoration.
In this project I develop a general workflow for training networks to restore corrupted images, and then apply this
workflow on two different tasks: (i) image denoising, and (ii) image deblurring.


The method I implemented consists of the following three steps:
1. Collect “clean” images, apply simulated random corruptions, and extract small patches.
2. Train a neural network to map from corrupted patches to clean patches.
3. Given a corrupted image, use the trained network to restore the complete image by restoring each
patch separately, by applying the “ConvNet Trick” for approximating this process as learned in
